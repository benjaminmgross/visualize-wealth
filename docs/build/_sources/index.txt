Why `The Visualize Wealth Library
 <https://github.com/benjaminmgross/wealth-viz>`_ Exists
**********************************************************************************

If you’re anything like me, you sit at home waiting with baited breath... nervously 
wringing your hands... waiting for your brokerage account statement
arrive.  Pure adrenaline comes over you when those comprehensive illustrations of "how your portfolio has performed"
over the past month, year, several years... and what exactly you’ve done well, and
how to continue improving as someone who “manages your own wealth”
are finally in your hot little hands.  Clearly I jest, but if you want to
really **dig** into portfolio management, there aren't a lot of tools
out there that help you understand academic concepts (like Sharpe
Ratios, Risk Adjusted Excess Returns, etc.) *within the context* of your
portfolio.

Be the Change
=============

So I've put together a fairly comprehensive "construction engine" for
:ref:`constructing-portfolios` that can create
portfolios for you in three different ways (more on that later).  Then, I've also put together a module that has all of the
back-end calculations for :ref:`analyzing-portfolio-performance`.
With those two basic tools, you should be able to begin the process of
constructing more comprehensive analytical tools... that's what
I'm doing, anyway.  This `Git Repository <https://github.com/benjaminmgross/grind-my-ass-ets>`_ is the backend
for a visualization engine that I'm creating to aid investors and
financial advisors better understand the impact of choices they make.

But enough about me... enjoy, and please feel free to email me at
